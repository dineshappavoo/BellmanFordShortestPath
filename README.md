Bellman - Ford Shortest Path 
=======================

BellmanFord Shortest Path algorithm implementation in java.

The Bellman–Ford algorithm is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other
vertices in aweighted digraph.It is slower than Dijkstra's algorithm for the same problem, but more versatile, as it is
capable of handling graphs in which some of the edge weights are negative numbers. The algorithm is usually named after
two of its developers, Richard Bellman andLester Ford, Jr., who published it in 1958 and 1956, respectively.

##Complexity
	  Worst case performance  O (|V| |E|)
	  Worst case space complexity O (|V|)

##Functionality

This library has the implementaion of Bellamn Ford algorithm to find the shortest path in a directed graph G=[V,E].The 
following code snippet shows how to get the shortest path,

    BellmanFordAlgorithm bellmanFord=new BellmanFordAlgorithm();
    bellmanFord.findShortestPath();

###Input
	3 3
	1 2 1
	2 3 2
	1 3 3

First integer is the total number of vertices |V| in the graph G. The next integer is the number of edges |E| in the graph.
Next |E| lines has the edges information (u, v, w). All inputs must be given through terminal.

###Output
	 Distance for 1 is 0
	 Distance for 2 is 1
	 Distance for 3 is 3
